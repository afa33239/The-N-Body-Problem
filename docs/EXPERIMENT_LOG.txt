dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-3, steps = 2000, softening = 1e-3

Scenario:
Random 3D N-body system (N = 15) with random initial positions, velocities, and masses.
Same initial conditions used for both solvers.

Expected:
- Energy: bounded but noisy due to chaotic dynamics
- Angular momentum: conserved for Direct, approximate for Barnes–Hut
- Linear momentum: near-constant with small fluctuations
- Center-of-mass: similar drift for both solvers

Observed:
- Relative energy drift:
  Direct and Barnes–Hut remain bounded, with step-like changes during close encounters.

  Nearly identical between solvers, indicating no major bias from Barnes–Hut.

Conclusion:
For small chaotic N-body systems, Barnes–Hut reproduces DirectSolver dynamics qualitatively and remains numerically stable.
Observed deviations are consistent with known approximation errors and chaotic sensitivity, not integrator failure.

Scenario:
Random 3D N-body system (N = 15, seed = 42) with random initial positions, velocities, and masses.
Same initial conditions used for both solvers.

Expected:
- Decreasing θ should increase accuracy (Barnes–Hut closer to Direct), at the cost of more tree traversal.
- Energy remains bounded but may show step-like changes due to close encounters.
- Angular momentum: Direct nearly constant; Barnes–Hut should improve vs larger θ but still not perfectly conserved.
- Linear momentum and COM: Barnes–Hut should track Direct more closely as θ decreases.

Observed:
- Relative energy drift:
  Barnes–Hut (θ = 0.3) is significantly closer to Direct than θ = 0.7; both remain bounded.
- Angular momentum drift:
  Barnes–Hut shows bounded deviation; Direct remains essentially flat.
- |P(t)|:
  Barnes–Hut overlaps Direct closely after initialization.
- Center-of-mass drift:
  Barnes–Hut overlaps Direct closely over the full run.

Conclusion:
Reducing θ improves Barnes–Hut accuracy as expected, bringing invariants and drift behavior closer to the DirectSolver baseline.
System remains stable under Leapfrog, and deviations are consistent with controlled approximation error.

Next actions:
- Repeat θ sweep for θ = 0.5 and θ = 1.0 using the same N/seed.
- Record how energy/ang-momentum drift change with θ to characterize accuracy vs approximation strength.
