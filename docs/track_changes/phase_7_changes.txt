[Step A – Scenes] 

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added code/nbody/scenes.py
- Implemented two_body, three_body, random_cluster, disk scenes

REASONS:
- Provide reproducible starting systems for Phase 7 demos

WHAT WORKED:
- Scenes integrate cleanly with existing Body class
- Seeded randomness gives reproducible clusters and disks

ISSUES/ FIXES
- Initial attempt used tuple-based Body constructor (fixed)
- Adjusted velocity and mass ranges for stability

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT
- Function-based scenes instead of classes (simpler design)

NEXT ACTION
- Implement demo runner (CLI)
