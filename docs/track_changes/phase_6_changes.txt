-- This document records high-level changes and decisions made throughout Phase 6. --





DATE
24/01/2026

Change:
Removed unoptimized octree compute_accelerations and kept optimized implementation only.

Reason:
Optimized version already showed real runtime improvements and reduced confusion.

Outcome:
Code simplified and optimized path consistently used.

Decision:
Kept.

Next:
Address repeated Barnes–Hut force evaluations per timestep.





DATE
24/01/2026

Change:
Cached Barnes–Hut accelerations across Leapfrog step and synchronize.

Reason:
Profiling showed Barnes–Hut force evaluation was being repeated multiple times per timestep.

Outcome:
Profiling time reduced significantly and total function calls dropped.

Decision:
Kept.

Next:
Look for remaining redundant work inside Barnes–Hut tree traversal.
