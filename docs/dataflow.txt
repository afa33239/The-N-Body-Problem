DATA FLOW 

Simulation calls the integrator each timestep.

Integrator asks the solver for accelerations.

Solver uses physics formulas to compute accelerations.

Integrator updates positions and velocities.

Integrator returns a new SystemState.

Flow:
Simulation -> Integrator -> Solver -> Physics -> New SystemState
