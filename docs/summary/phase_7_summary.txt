-- This document records a brief summary during implementation of Phase 7 that is reviewed at the end of the phase. --


[Step A - Predefined Scences]

OBJECTIVE
- Introduce predefined simulation scenes to make demonstrations reproducible and easy to run.
- Provide clear starting systems for testing solvers, integrators, and visualization.

WHAT WAS ADDED
- A new scenes module containing predefined initial conditions.
- Implemented the following scenes:
  - two_body (simple orbital system)
  - three_body (chaotic system)
  - random_cluster (seeded random N-body system)
  - disk (rotating disk-like system for animation demos)
- Added helper functions to list scenes and select scenes by name.

VISUALIZATION (PLOTS + ANIMATION)
- No visualization implemented at this stage.
- Scenes were designed with future plotting and animation in mind, especially the disk scene.

INTERFACE (RUNNING THE PROJECT)
- Scenes are accessed programmatically via a scene selection function.
- Scene selection is designed to integrate cleanly with the upcoming command-line runner.

KEY DECISIONS
- Used functions instead of classes for scenes to keep the design simple.
- Kept scenes independent from simulation configuration (dt, steps, solver).
- Used seeded randomness for reproducibility in random-based scenes.
- Included a disk scene to support clear and visually appealing animations.

LIMITATIONS
- Scene parameters are not yet exposed through a user-facing interface.
- The disk scene is a simplified model and not physically exact.

HOW TO RUN (FINAL)
- Not applicable at this stage (runner script not yet implemented).

RESULTS / EXAMPLES (FINAL)
- Not applicable at this stage.

NEXT STEPS
- Implement the command-line demo runner.
- Connect scene selection to solver and integrator selection.
- Begin adding basic plotting utilities.

LEARNING
- Improved understanding of flexible function interfaces using **kwargs.
- Reinforced the importance of reproducibility through seeded randomness.
- Gained experience separating initial condition logic from simulation and execution logic.
