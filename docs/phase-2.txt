PHASE 2 SUMMARY

Energy types:
- Kinetic energy: 1/2 m v^2
- Potential energy: -G m1 m2 / r
- Total energy = K + U
- Angular momentum optional

Energy formulas should live in physics.py.

Simulation should record:
- energy_history
- kinetic_history
- potential_history
- angular_momentum_history

After each step, Simulation calls physics functions to compute and store energies.

The simulation should also deal with energy and momenutm drifts appropriately to leapfrog integrator (currently).

This will be used later to test integrator stability, Barnes–Hut accuracy, and adaptive timestep behavior.
