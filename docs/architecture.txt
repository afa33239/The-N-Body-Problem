N-BODY SIMULATION PROJECT — SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

This project is organized like a small physics engine.
Each file has one clear job so that the code is easier to understand, test, and expand.

FILES AND THEIR PURPOSES

bodies.py
Contains the basic data structures.

Body: stores one object's mass, position, and velocity.

SystemState: stores a list of all bodies at one moment in time.
This file does not contain any physics or simulation logic. It only defines the data.

physics.py
Contains the gravitational equations.

compute_accelerations: calculates the acceleration on each body due to gravity from all other bodies.
This file is only responsible for the physics formulas and nothing else.

engine.py
Contains the main simulation controller.

SimulationConfig: defines settings such as timestep (dt) and total time.

Simulation: runs the simulation by repeatedly calling the solver (to get forces) and the integrator (to update positions).
This file organizes the workflow but does not implement physics or integration itself.

integrators/ (folder)
Contains the algorithms that update positions and velocities.

init.py defines the Integrator base class (interface).

euler.py contains EulerIntegrator, a simple time-stepping method.
Integrators decide "how to move forward in time" once forces are known.

solvers/ (folder)
Contains methods for computing forces.

init.py defines the Solver base class (interface).

direct.py contains DirectSolver, which computes all pairwise forces using the formula in physics.py.
Solvers decide "how we calculate gravitational forces."

testing.py
A small script used to test that the whole system runs correctly.

SUMMARY OF THE DESIGN

Bodies.py defines what the objects are.
Physics.py defines the laws of physics used to compute forces.
Solvers decide how to compute accelerations (direct, or later Barnes-Hut).
Integrators decide how to update positions and velocities using acceleration.
Engine.py coordinates solvers and integrators to run a full simulation.
Testing.py checks that everything works.
