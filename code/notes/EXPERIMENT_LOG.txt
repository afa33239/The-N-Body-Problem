Integrator: LeapFrog (sympletic)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, timesteps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system in 2D.
Planet initialized on circular orbit at r = 1 with v = 2π.
Sun given compensating velocity to ensure total linear momentum ≈ 0.
Used as a baseline validation test for conservation laws.

Expected:

Total energy should exhibit small bounded oscillations with no secular drift.
COM-frame angular momentum should be conserved to machine precision.
Linear momentum should remain constant (center of mass stationary).

Observed max energy drift: 

1e-11 (bounded oscillation, no secular trend)

Observed max L_com drift:

1e-15 (machine precision)

Observed max |P| drift:

Not explicitly measured in this test.
COM remains stationary, implying |P| ≈ 0 within numerical precision.

Next action: Add explicit linear momentum and center-of-mass drift diagnostics to complete Phase 2 validation.







DATE: 14/12/25
Integrator: Leapfrog (Velocity Verlet)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, steps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system, near-circular orbit.
Initial total linear momentum ≈ 0.
Measurements taken in diagnostic (time-aligned) state.

Expected:
- Energy: bounded oscillations, no secular drift
- Angular momentum (COM frame): conserved to machine precision
- Linear momentum: 0 up to floating-point noise
- COM position: no systematic drift

Observed max energy drift: 1.6 × 10⁻⁹ (bounded oscillation)

Observed max L_com drift: 2 × 10⁻¹⁵

Observed max |P| drift: 3 × 10⁻¹⁷

Observed COM drift: 1 × 10⁻¹⁷

Conclusion:
Integrator behaves correctly. Conservation laws satisfied to expected numerical precision.

Next action:
Compare to Eulers.






DATE: 14/12/25
Integrator: Euler (Forward Euler)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, steps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system, near-circular orbit.
Same initial conditions as Leapfrog comparison.

Expected:
- Energy: secular (linear) drift
- Angular momentum: secular drift
- Linear momentum: growing error
- Center-of-mass: noticeable drift

Observed max energy drift: 1.5 × 10⁻² (linear growth)

Observed max angular momentum drift: 8 × 10⁻³ (linear growth)

Observed max |P| drift: 4 × 10⁻¹⁷

Observed COM drift: 1.5 × 10⁻¹⁷

Conclusion:
Euler integrator exhibits expected non-conservation of invariants.
Results clearly contrast with Leapfrog and validate diagnostic framework.

Next action:
Use Leapfrog as default integrator.
Proceed to Phase 3 (3D extension).
