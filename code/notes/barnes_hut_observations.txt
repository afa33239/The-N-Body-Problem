arnes–Hut accuracy is controlled by the angle parameter θ, which governs when distant node clusters are approximated as a single mass.

Observed Trends
Across all tests (N = 15, Leapfrog integrator):

θ = 0.3:
- Barnes–Hut closely matches DirectSolver
- Energy drift is bounded and minimal
- Angular momentum drift is small and stable
- Linear momentum and center-of-mass drift nearly overlap DirectSolver
- Highest accuracy, deepest tree traversal

θ = 0.5:
- Moderate approximation error
- Energy and angular momentum drift increase but remain bounded
- Center-of-mass drift slightly larger than θ = 0.3
- Clear tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency

θ = 0.7:
- Noticeable deviation from DirectSolver
- Angular momentum and COM drift become more pronounced
- Still numerically stable under Leapfrog integration
- Suitable for larger N when performance matters more than precision

θ = 1.0:
- Aggressive approximation
- Large bounded deviations in energy and angular momentum
- Significant center-of-mass drift due to force asymmetry
- No numerical instability, but reduced physical fidelity



Key Conclusions:
- Decreasing θ monotonically improves accuracy
- Increasing θ monotonically increases approximation error
- All θ values tested remain stable under symplectic integration
- Barnes–Hut errors are controlled and bounded, not runaway
- Results match theoretical expectations for Barnes–Hut solvers
